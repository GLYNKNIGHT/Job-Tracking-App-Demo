# Progress

  
When I starting to look for my first development job I wanted a way to keep a track of the jobs I was interest in, or had appied for (Progress). So rather than use a speadsheet I built this app.

The app allows users to add and remove each job as well as add notes and update if they have been invited for interview or received an offer.

Built in React the app is designed be be used in the browser on laptop/desktop (To run the front end use; *npm start*) . Progress uses JSON-Server as a development backend. To run the JSON Server use : *npx json-server -p 8000 -w data/db.json*

  
  

**Features I would like to add;**
- Add sort feature to list the jobs by date, salary, or progress
- Make responive for mobile
