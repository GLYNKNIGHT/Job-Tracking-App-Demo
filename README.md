# Progress

  
When I started to look for my first development job I wanted a way to keep a track of the jobs I was interest in, or had appied for (Progress). So rather than use a speadsheet I built this app.

The app allows users to add and remove each job as well as add notes and update if they have been invited for interview or received an offer.

Built in React the app is designed be be used in the browser on laptop/desktop (To run the front end use; *npm start*) . Progress uses JSON-Server as a development backend. To run the JSON Server use : *npm run server*

I have also used Cypress and React Testing Library for testing    
  

**Features I would like to add;**
- Add sort feature to list the jobs by date, salary, or progress. (Update - now a working filter for Applied/ Not Applied, Interview and Still in Progress)
- Make responsive for mobile (Update - Main page is now responsive at 800px wide the jobs list changed to a carousel and the form moves below the list. Still working on the Update card).
